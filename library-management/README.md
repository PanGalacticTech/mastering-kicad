# Library Management

## Introduction

KiCAD is professional level schematic capture and PCB design tool. 
It is open source and freely available and this is one of the reasons I am a huge fan of it, the others being its easy of use and the logic behind its workflow.

But I think my favoure feature of KiCAD is how easy it is to modify and define your own libaries to suit the kind of engineering you do. However, library management
is one of the more difficult concepts and workflows to become confident with.

So that is why I am writing this series of tutorials to help you master library management in KiCAD 7.0!
